# React Calculator

This project is a simple React calculator that allows users to add and remove rows, each with a sign (plus or minus) and a value. Rows can be enabled or disabled, and the result is updated live as the user interacts with the calculator.

## Features

- Each row has a sign (plus or minus) and a value.
- Rows can be enabled or disabled using a toggle switch.
- Disabled rows are excluded from the calculation.
